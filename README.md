# BooksAPI
Node.js RestAPI for books library stored in MongoDB

This server allows users to register and log in (authenticate). Upon successful authentication, user recieves an accessToken (via jsonwebtoken in json format) and a refreshToken (via cookie) which is saved in db for that user. User can have 3 levels of authorization (Admin, Editor, User) and depending on that a user can access different actions in the api/books.js route. "User" level can get a list of all the books or an individual book from the library (database) with the response in json format. "Editor" level can post new books or edit an existing one while "Admin" can do all aforementioned and additionally delete a book from the database. "Admin" also has access to the api/users.js route where he can get a specific user or a list of all registered users from the db, update user information (ex. change authorization level or password) or delete a user from the db. User can refresh their accessToken via refresh route, refreshToken from users cookie is sent to server and compared with the refreshToken saved in the db for the specific user. If verified, user gets a new accessToken via json response. Finally, when user logs out, its cookie is cleared and the refreshToken deleted from the db. All the books and users information is stored in MongoDB.
